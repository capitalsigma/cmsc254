Requirements: 
python 3 (written and tested in 3.3)
pillow 2.3.0 (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/)

Usage: kmeans.py path_in n_centers [path_out [fmt]]

The script must be provided with the path to an image and a number of
cluster centers. If path_out is provided, the script writes the result
to that location, and if fmt is a valid image type, then it writes the
result as that image type. If fmt is not provided, it attempts to use
the extension of the original file that was provided. If neither are
provided, it displays the new image to the user.

For ease of use, the script "show (small)|(large) k" can also be run
in the root directory, which will display either mandrill-small.tiff
or mandrill-large.tiff after being processed by the kmeans algorithm
for k cluster centers.
